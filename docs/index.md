Smartbox Integrations Framework Skeleton
========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smartboxgroup/smartbox-skeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smartboxgroup/smartbox-skeleton) [![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/smartboxgroup/smartbox-skeleton/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/smartboxgroup/smartbox-skeleton/?branch=master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/smartboxgroup/smartbox-skeleton/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/smartboxgroup/smartbox-skeleton?branch=master)

A Symfony project to get you up and running quickly with the Smartbox Enterprise Service Bus.
This project will demonstrate a bare bones setup of a the Smartbox Open Source bundles.


### Current status

This is the initial version of the skeleton bundle and will require more documentation, code cleanups, more tests and examples of functionality. 

For further information on the Smartbox Integration Framework Bundle please read the [setup guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartboxgroup/integration-framework-bundle/master/README.md). 

You can access the Smartbox open source bundle via our [GitHub](https://github.com/smartboxgroup/) or using [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/smartbox/).


### Getting started:
Please note that all the urls below are using `app_dev.php`, this is simply for testing purposes.
The remote system is mocked by the bundle `SmartboxSkeletonRemoteDemoBundle`.
The main code for the Skeleton project is in the `SmartboxSkeletonBundle`.

Descriptions will be added to code blocks in time. Please be patient... Or feel free to contribute :D


#### To send pings via the command line and consume use the following:

* `php app/console skeleton:send:ping`
* `php app/console skeleton:send:async-ping`
* `php app/console smartesb:consumer:start queue://api/normal/skeleton/v0/asyncping`

#### To send a synchronous ping via the web api endpoint:

Send a GET request to:
* `http://localhost/skeleton/web/app_dev.php/api/ping`

#### To send an asynchronous ping message via the web api endpoint:
Send a POST request to:

* `http://localhost/skeleton/web/app_dev.php/api/asyncping`

With a PingMessage body:
```json
{
  "_type": "SmartboxSkeletonBundle\\Entity\\PingMessage",
  "message": "Ping",
  "timestamp": "1537122194"
}
```
